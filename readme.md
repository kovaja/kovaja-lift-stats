# LIFT-STATS
There is one building I am visiting every day. I can use 4 elevators. I can visit five floors.
This app is trying to guess the lift that will come to my floor at given day and time.

My presonal playground to learn how neural networks work.

- Node express api, mongodb and UI with react

## Current state
 - User can get a guess
 - User can send correct answer (lift that has actually arrived)
 - User can display all records in DB

## TODOS
 - Weights from where the guess is computed are adjusted by correct answer
